# Recipe Recon

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, we often find ourselves struggling to balance our love for food with our busy lifestyles. That's why we decided to develop a revolutionary solution: an image-base cooking wizard software designed specifically for inexperienced home cooks. 

Recipe Recon is a mobile application that generates recipes based on the ingredients users have in their fridge or pantry. Using a camera to capture ingredient images, the app will provides users with recipe suggestions based on the ingredient they have. 

Simply scan the ingredients you have on hand, and our app will suggest mouth-watering recipes and provide step-by-step cooking guidance. Say goodbye to kitchen stress and hello to a world of flavours!
